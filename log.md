##Week 1: 2/19/17 - 2/25/17

**This week's project**: [Meme viewer](https://github.com/brendacs/meme-viewer)

**Notes**: This was a suggestion from a friend since our university loves memes. I could visualize right away how I would create this and knew it wouldn't be too hard since it would require very little JavaScript. I was mostly right. It reminded me of how I made [Simple Clock](https://github.com/brendacs/simple-clock) and along the way I realized that I probably could have made the clock more efficient. I made some changes to the meme viewer's JavaScript after I initially finished because it showed images in the same order every time and stopped once it got to the end of the array of images. I learned how to generate random integers so that I could grab a random image from the array instead. I can see this project getting more complicated if I eventually carry out some other ideas I have for it in the future, but for now it's done. A simple but good start to the challenge I'd say!

##Week 2: 2/26/17 - 3/4/17

**This week's project**: [People generator](https://github.com/brendacs/people-generator)

**Notes**: I decided to work with APIs this week because there are a lot of websites/apps I want to create that are only possible with APIs. I started with a simple one that I came across called the Random User Generator which is usually for generating random users for databases. I skimmed through the documentation for it and an article that used it. Then I watched a tutorial and followed it in coding a super simple webpage using jQuery to work with API, JSON, and AJAX (I knew none of these four things). With those stepping stones and StackOverflow under my belt, I started to code this generator, and I can definitely say I learned so much from it this week. One part of this project, the JavaScript modals that show the rest of the random people's info, is still in progress, but otherwise it is pretty much done!
