##Week 1: 2/19/17 - 2/25/17

**This week's project**: [Meme generator](https://github.com/brendacs/meme-generator)

**Notes**: This was a suggestion from a friend since our university loves memes. I could visualize right away how I would create this and knew it wouldn't be too hard since it would require very little JavaScript. I was mostly right. It reminded me of how I made [Simple Clock](https://github.com/brendacs/simple-clock) and along the way I realized that I probably could have made the clock more efficient. I made some changes to the meme generator's JavaScript after I initially finished because it generated images in the same order every time and stopped once it got to the end of the array of images. I learned how to generate random integers so that I could grab a random image from the array instead. I can see this project getting more complicated if I eventually carry out some other ideas I have for it in the future, but for now it's done. A simple but good start to the challenge I'd say!
