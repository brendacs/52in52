##Why I am doing it

I've been coding in HTML and CSS for about 8 months now since I self-learned them in the summer of 2016 and have begun self-learning JavaScript since over a month ago. I've created over 20 projects during that time, but I still feel as if I have so much to learn and have not been dedicating myself enough to learning them.

With all sorts of excuses while in college, side projects can easily be brushed aside and ignored for long periods of time. Doing this challenge publicly will force me to code something new every weekend and do all the things I have been meaning to do while learning all the things I've been meaning to learn.
